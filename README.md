# CLIProject

This is my CLI Project

When you run...

Program will ask you what you want...
Specific Player? or Top 10? - Y for Specific option or N for Top 10
    Specific Player will ask for a rank and then will output the data for that player
    Top 10 will put out Top 10 Players in the rankings
Again or Exit - Y to run again and N to Stop
