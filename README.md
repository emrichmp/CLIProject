# CLIProject

This is my CLI Project

When you run...

Program will ask you what you want...
Specific Player? or Top 10? - 1 for Specific option or 0 for Top 10
    Specific Player will ask for a rank and then will output the data for that player
    Top 10 will put out Top 10 Players in the rankings and their data
User will be asked if we want to go again - 1 for yes, 0 for no.
    If yes than the program will restart, if no the program will leave a conluding message
